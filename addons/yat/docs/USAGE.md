## Keybindings

To use this extension, you need to create these keybindings in your project:

-   `yat_toggle` - Toggles the state of the overlay.
-   `yat_history_previous` - Displays the previous command from history.
-   `yat_history_next` - Displays the next command from history.

## Options

### YAT enable file

You can make YAT accessible only when a specific file (default .yatenable)
is present in either the `user://` or `res://` directory (default user://).

This makes it easy to restrict terminal access to players without removing the extension.
