### Custom windows

YAT internally uses the `YatWindow` node to create windows.
If you want to create your own windows for your commands, I recommend creating them by inheriting from `YatWindow`.

This way, the window will behave similarly to native windows and its appearance will be consistent, plus you will get access to many additional out-of-the-box features.

Any windows should be added to `Yat.Windows` for order and clarity.

You can add your window this way:

```csharp
Yat.Windows.AddChild(_yourWindow);
```

### Scaling with the main viewport

The `YatWindow` is able to scale to always contain itself in the `main viewport`.
To use this functionality, all you need to do is to use `base._Ready();` in the `_Ready` method of your window.

Using the variable `ViewportEdgeOffset` you can adjust how much the YatWindow will be smaller than the main viewport.
