### Aborting the command

> Note that sending an interrupt signal does not necessarily mean immediate termination of the command.
>
> Whether and when the command terminates depends on the command and whether it respects the request.

Interrupting a command is possible only if it runs on a `separate thread` (and if its work does not end in a fraction of a second).

To terminate the command you must use the keybinding `yat_terminal_interrupt`.

### Context menu

YAT uses the keybinding `yat_context_menu` to launch the context menu.
