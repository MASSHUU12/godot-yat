### Calling methods on nodes

> [!NOTE]
> Please keep in mind that this feature is still in development.
>
> Many things may not work as expected.
>
> Method chaining is not yet working as it should. At the moment, the chained methods will be run one at a time on the selected node, not on the returned data.

The terminal in `YAT` can operate in two modes: by default, the terminal treats any input as `commands` and tries to parse them.

The second mode allows you to run `methods` on the currently selected `node`, this mode is triggered by giving a `$` character at the beginning of the input data.

To run a method, you just need to specify the whole name, in the case of methods built in Godot, the names are written in `snake_case`.

### Changing selected node

To change the selected node, use the `cn` command.

### Checking available methods

To see what methods are available for a particular node, use the `ls` command with the `-m` option.

If you want to check the methods for the currently selected node, use `ls . -m`.
