### Creating commands

Creating a command that runs on a separate thread looks very similar to creating a [regular command](./REGULAR_COMMANDS.md).

Therefore, first create a `regular command` and then add a `Threaded` attribute to it, which allows it to run on a separate thread.

### Command execution

The execution of the command begins in the `Execute` method.

YAT supports two types of `Execute` method for threaded commands:

```csharp
public CommandResult Execute(CancellationToken ct, params string[] args)
```

Basic version, passes raw arguments, works with and without automatic validation.
Accepts the `CancellationToken`, which indicates when the command was asked to terminate prematurely.

```csharp
public CommandResult Execute(Dictionary<string, object> cArgs, params string[] args)
```

It works similarly to the basic version with the difference that one of the arguments is a dictionary with the arguments converted to the appropriate types.
