### YatEnable

Yat allows you to restrict access to the terminal via the `YatEnable` file located in the `user://` or `res://` directories.

The file name as well as the target directory can be customized.

If the file is present, Yat is available, otherwise running the terminal is not possible.

Checking for the presence of the file is only done during Ready.
