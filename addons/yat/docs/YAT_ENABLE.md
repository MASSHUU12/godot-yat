<br />

If you don't want users to access the terminal, you can easily **block** access to YAT in several different ways. By default YAT is **accessible**, you can change this in the `YatEnable` scene, which is a child of the `YAT` scene.

Checking whether the requirements to allow access to YAT have been met is done only once during the startup of the plugin.

Requirements can be combined, when one of them is met YAT will become available.

### File

You can set the terminal to become accessible only if the specified file (default `.yatenable`) is in the `user://` and/or `res://` directory.

### CMD argument

The access restriction can also be lifted when the specified argument (default `--yat`) is passed to the executable file.

The argument can be passed this way:

```bash
my_awesome_game -- --yat
```

Note the two hyphens preceding the argument, without them it won't work.
