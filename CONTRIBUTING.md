## How to Contribute

### Reporting issues

   Be as descriptive as possible. Include steps to reproduce the issue, the expected result, and any relevant screenshots or logs.

### Contributing code

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the repository to your own GitHub account and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., feat-add-new-feature or fix-issue-123).
3. **Write Tests**: If your contribution includes code, please write tests to ensure your changes are robust and maintainable.
4. **Commit Changes**: Make your changes in your branch. Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.
5. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository.
6. **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request from your forked repository to the main repository.

### Commit messages

Clear and structured commit messages help in understanding the history of the project.
Use the following prefixes to categorize your commits:

- **feat**: A new feature (e.g., feat: add user authentication)
- **fix**: A bug fix (e.g., fix: resolve null pointer exception on login)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes (e.g., docs: update contributing guidelines)
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.) (e.g., style: format code according to style guide)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (e.g., refactor: optimize user data processing)
- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests (e.g., test: add unit tests for user service)
- **chore**: Miscellaneous commits (e.g., modifying .gitignore)

2. **Linting**: Use the project’s configured linter to check your code for style issues before submitting.
3. **Documentation**: Update the documentation to reflect your changes if they affect the public API or usage instructions.

### Editor configuration

To maintain consistency in coding styles, please use an editor that supports the .editorconfig file included in the repository.
This file helps maintain consistent coding styles between different contributors and editors.
Most popular editors have plugins or built-in support for .editorconfig.
